# Review

Review performed by Mathijs Kappetijn:

Aspect: names<br>
Not every variable name is according to the style guide.<br>
Example: <br>
static public Game game;<br>
Most of MainActivity.java<br>
Next time:<br>
Read the style guide and start with using the correct syntax.<br>

Aspect: headers<br>
Headers are mostly missing.<br>
Example: <br>
LoginFragment.java<br>
Next time:<br>
When you create the file, paste a sample header. This way you don't forget it.<br>

Aspect: comments<br>
There are some comments, but not much.<br>
Example: <br>
MainActivity.java<br>
Next time:<br>
When creating a new method, put comment tags above it and explain what the function does.<br>

Aspect: layout<br>
Looking good, but don't forget old code or TODO comments!<br>
Example: <br>
QuizFragment.java<br>
GameActivity.java<br>
Next time:<br>
Check your code while searching for comment tags, this way you can't overlook it.<br>

Aspect: formatting<br>
Formatting looks good and are all the same.<br>
Example: <br>
Every file<br>
Next time:<br>
Keep it up!<br>

Aspect: flow<br>
Looks good, but try to make generic functions/standard functions less important than your own functions!<br>
Example:<br>
MultipleQuestionFragment.java<br>
Next time:<br>
Put the generic functions at the bottem.<br>

Aspect: idiom<br>
Looking good.<br>
Example:<br>
Every file<br>
Next time:<br>
Keep it up!<br>

Aspect: expressions<br>
Looking good, but try to use the same variable/function for everything the same.<br>
Example:<br>
MultipleQuestionFragment.java<br>
Next time:<br>
Check your code one more time if you have changed everything.<br>

Aspect: decomposition<br>
Looking mostly good, but some functions can have an improvement<br>
Example:<br>
GameActivity.java<br>
Next time:<br>
Try to break very long functions apart.<br>


Aspect: modularization<br>
This is looking good. Every file has its own function.<br>
Example:<br>
Every file<br>
Next time:<br>
Keep it up!<br>
