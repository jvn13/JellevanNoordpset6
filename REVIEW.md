# Review

Review performed by Mathijs Kappetijn:

Aspect: names
Not every variable name is according to the style guide.
Example: 
static public Game game;
Most of MainActivity.java
Next time:
Read the style guide and start with using the correct syntax.

Aspect: headers
Headers are mostly missing.
Example: 
LoginFragment.java
Next time:
When you create the file, paste a sample header. This way you don't forget it.

Aspect: comments
There are some comments, but not much.
Example: 
MainActivity.java
Next time:
When creating a new method, put comment tags above it and explain what the function does.

Aspect: layout
Looking good, but don't forget old code or TODO comments!
Example: 
QuizFragment.java
GameActivity.java
Next time:
Check your code while searching for comment tags, this way you can't overlook it.

Aspect: formatting
Formatting looks good and are all the same.
Example: 
Every file
Next time:
Keep it up!

Aspect: flow
Looks good, but try to make generic functions/standard functions less important than your own functions!
Example:
MultipleQuestionFragment.java
Next time:
Put the generic functions at the bottem.

Aspect: idiom
Looking good.
Example:
Every file
Next time:
Keep it up!

Aspect: expressions
Looking good, but try to use the same variable/function for everything the same.
Example:
MultipleQuestionFragment.java
Next time:
Check your code one more time if you have changed everything.

Aspect: decomposition
Looking mostly good, but some functions can have an improvement
Example:
GameActivity.java
Next time:
Try to break very long functions apart.


Aspect: modularization
This is looking good. Every file has its own function.
Example:
Every file
Next time:
Keep it up!
